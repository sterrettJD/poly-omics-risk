# Metatranscriptomics

This subdirectory contains scripts used for the metatranscriptomics (MTS) analyses.

The primary script in this directory is `metatranscriptomics_lasso_script.R`, which transforms data, runs LASSO for feature selection, and exports feature importance scores and metagenomics "risk scores" for individuals.
