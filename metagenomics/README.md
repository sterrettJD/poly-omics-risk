# Metagenomics

This subdirectory contains scripts used for the metagenomics analyses.

The most important script in this directory is `metagenomics_lasso_script.R`, which transforms data, runs LASSO for feature selection, and exports feature importance scores and metagenomics "risk scores" for individuals.
